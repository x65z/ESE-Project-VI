<h2 id="Week4">Week 4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Started working on Buttons for the elevator</li>
	<li>We decided to use a 7 Segment display instead of using LCD or LED's</li>
	<li>We also decided to use Axemans instead of out custom boards because we needed a full Port for 7 Segment and the breadboard attached to the Axemans made the circuits neater</li>
	<li>Assissted with port polling, and port initilization, PortB (B4-B7) was used for the buttons. PortA was used for the 7 segment display</li>
	<li>Built in buttons on PortJ (J6, J7) were used for open and close functions on the elevator.</li>
	<li>Resistors values for the 7 Segment required tweaks because when the button was pressed the 7 Segment dims in certain segments</li>
	<li>Breadboards had loose connections</li>
	<li>Assisted with testing of all the floors, and the elevator cart itself</li>
