		<h2 id="Week1">Week 1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Created GitHub account</li>
			<li>Found personal HCS12 board at home</li>
			<li>Set up local web server in Linux using VMware</li>
      <li>Looked through the CAN code to better understand how everything is getting set up and configured</li>
      <li>Have idea for during initialization. Wait loop after setting clock source to make sure board is synced to bus.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Week2">Week 2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Long Weekend, was busy with family</li>
			<li>Studied for math quiz</li>
		</ul>
    <h2 id="Week3">Week 3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Configured filters for elevator floors, have two ranges right now, 101 and 200-203</li>
      <li>Have the RxBuffer set to save to a location, will probably change this to a ring buffer</li>
      <li>Found out half of our bus adapters were not built correctly, got Dave to fix them</li>
      <li>Made the board send out a message once after initialization is done. Reset board to resend</li>
      <li>Connected 3 axmans to the bus configured to send different messages. Confirmed messages are being sent, recieved, and stored</li>
      <li>Set one axman to send on an id not supported by the filters (ID 300) confirmed that the boards see the message on the bus, but will not store them</li>
    </ul>
		<h2 id="Week4">Week 4</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Ristricted filters on Axmans to ID 100 exclusively, allowing for only elevator controller messages to be recieved</li>
			<li>Modified the sample pi code to allow for an additional function. This function listens for messages on the bus and relays adiquate messages to the elevator controller. The code also displays recieved messages on the bus on screen for debug purposes</li>
			<li>Created elevator car code, Hamza added a 7 segment and multiple buttons. We integrated them into Ports A and B respectively. We then used the built in buttons to control the door open and closed functions.</li>
			<li>Updated Floor controllers to use external buttons to request a floor as well as sync elevator position with the elevator controller and the elevator car. No longer request floor by resetting board</li>
			<li>Offered notes for the test plan</li>
			<li>Assisted with testing of total functionality</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Week5">Week 5</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied for Math Midterm</li>
      <li>Studied for Datacomm quiz</li>
      <li>Practiced with CSS</li>
      <li>Added CSS to logbook</li>
    </ul>
		<h2 id="Week6">Week 6</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Installed Atom and enabled the live HTML viewing option</li>
			<li>Remade Team Logo</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Studied for Natural Science Test</li>
			<li>Studied for Thermodynamics Test</li>
			<li>Worked with Hamza on Bootstrap and adding a LogBook hub</li>
			<li>Ran into issues with formatting, but Mike hepled us with ClearFix</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Week8">Week 8</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A lot of issues with our GITHUB, we ended up changing the format of our branches</li>
			<li>Hamza and I finished the functionality of the Log Book Hub, flipping and buttons work as links into our individual log books</li>
			<li>Had interview in Wednesday for CloudDx</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Week9">Week 9</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Short week</li>
			<li>Studied for Datacomm</li>
			<li>Studied for Software</li>
			<li>Wrote Software Midterm, will implement improvements made during Midterm into project</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Week10">Week 10</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated Log in and User addition from Midterm</li>
			<li>Worked with Zack to adapt mySQL to the login/sign up pages made in Midterm</li>
			<li>Found out with Hamza that ATOM is not case sensitive, but web browswers are</li>
			<li>Worked with Niv on Database tables</li>
			<li>Studied for Math Exam</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Week11">Week 11</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Worked with Niv on Database setup</li>
			<li>Updated banners on many webpages with Hamza</li>
			<li>Worked with Hamza to make the elevator control page</li>
			<li>Niv and I connected to the database inside the Can Bus monitoring function</li>
			<li>Split the RelayMessage function into 2 separate functions</li>
			<li>BusToDatabase runs first, looks at the Can bus and puts any messages on it into the database</li>
			<li>DatabaseToBus looks at the Database, and if database value is different than the last request, it sends out the appropriate CAN message and adds an update to the debugLog</li>
			<li>Helped Hamza and Zack troubleshoot the front end database update code</li>
